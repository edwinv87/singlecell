# Single Cell

SingleCell is a python class for managing single-cell RNA-seq data. It contains three Pandas dataframes; data for holding gene expression values (counts/normalized counts), genedata for holding more information about the genes e.g., gene names, and celldata which contains more information about cells such as cell types etc. It is similar in concept to R package SingleCellExperiment on bioconductor.
